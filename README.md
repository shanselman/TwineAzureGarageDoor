TwineAzureGarageDoor
====================

A basic ASP.NET service for notifying me that my garage is open using the Twine box from Supermechanical

I need to add a CHRON job to Azure (or whatever site I host this at) but for now I just have PingDom check the /check URL.

I am also using a TRIAL Twilio account but it works OK because it's just one SMS for one number.
